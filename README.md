About Dataset
This dataset has been curated to facilitate machine learning tasks aimed at predicting fuel efficiency of vehicles. The original data has been meticulously cleaned and reduced to include only the most relevant features, enhancing usability for modeling and analysis.


Features:


r: Range, possibly indicating the total driving range of the vehicle.

m (kg): Mass of the vehicle in kilograms.

Mt: CO2 emissions in metric tons.

Ewltp (g/km): CO2 emissions measured under the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) in grams per kilometer.

Ft: Type of fuel used by the vehicle (e.g., petrol, diesel, electric).

Fm: Composition of the fuel mix used by the vehicle.

ec (cm3): Engine capacity in cubic centimeters.

ep (KW): Engine power output in kilowatts.

z (Wh/km): Energy consumption in watt-hours per kilometer.

Erwltp (g/km): CO2 emissions reduction in grams per kilometer measured under WLTP.

Fuel consumption: The target variable representing the fuel consumption of the vehicle.

Electric range (km): The maximum distance the vehicle can travel on electric power alone.



Usage:
This dataset is ideal for machine learning practitioners and researchers interested in developing models to predict fuel efficiency based on various vehicle characteristics. It is well-suited for regression tasks, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering exercises.
